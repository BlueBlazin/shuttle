## Highlights:

- No recording limits
- Runs entirely in the browser (videos aren't sent to any server)
- Free and open source

## Background:

I made this because I've found myself wanting to record screen captures several times. Loom is a great app but its free tier only allows you to record 5 minute videos. I didn't want to pay for it, so I made this instead.
